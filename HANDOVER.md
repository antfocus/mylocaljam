# myLocalJam — Venue Scraping Handover

## Project Overview
**mylocaljam.com** — Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS + Supabase site aggregating live music events from NJ shore venues. Deployed on Vercel. Auto-sync runs twice daily via Vercel cron.

---

## Current Event Count
**~1500+ events** across 39 active scrapers (as of March 24, 2026)

---

## Sync Infrastructure (complete ✅)
- **Route:** `src/app/api/sync-events/route.js` — runs all scrapers in parallel, maps to Supabase schema, batches upserts (50 at a time) with `onConflict: 'external_id'`
- **Cron:** `vercel.json` at root — runs at 6am & 6pm Eastern (UTC 11:00 and 23:00)
- **Auth:** `SYNC_SECRET` env var on Vercel — Bearer token required for GET/POST
- **Manual trigger from browser console (on mylocaljam.com):**
  ```javascript
  fetch('/api/sync-events', {method:'POST', headers:{'Authorization':'Bearer ' + atob('JCp7RyxiJCREZEpseCNDTw==')}}).then(r=>r.json()).then(d => console.log(JSON.stringify(d, null, 2)))
  ```
- **Global deduplication:** `seen` Set in route.js prevents "ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE" batch errors from duplicate external_ids
- **Auto artist enrichment:** After upserting events, the sync route automatically enriches new artists via Last.fm. Finds unenriched events (missing `image_url` or `artist_bio`), looks up to 30 new artists per sync on Last.fm, caches results in the `artists` table, and updates matching events. The sync response includes an `enrichment` field with `artistsLookedUp`, `eventsEnriched`, and any errors. Wrapped in try/catch so enrichment failures don't break the sync.
